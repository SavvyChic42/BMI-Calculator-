can create a BMI Calculator for all the fitness freaks out there. The BMI Calculator takes your height and weight as input and gives BMI (Body Mass Index) as an output. The source code link of a BMI calculator is provided below.


1.Set up the HTML structure:
Create an HTML file, and add basic HTML structure, including head and body tags.
Inside the body, create a container element (e.g., a <div>) to hold your calculator components.<br>
2.Design the user interface:
Add input fields for height and weight inside the container element.
Include radio buttons or a select element for the user to choose between metric and imperial units.
Create a button to trigger the BMI calculation.
Add an output element (e.g., a <p> or <div>) to display the calculated BMI, weight category, and recommendation.<br>
3.Write the JavaScript logic:
Create a function to calculate BMI when the calculate button is clicked. Attach this function to the button's onclick event.
Retrieve user inputs for height and weight from the input fields.
Convert imperial units to metric if needed (pounds to kilograms and inches to meters).
Perform the BMI calculation using the formula BMI = weight / (height ^ 2). Round the result to one decimal place.
Determine the user's weight category based on the WHO guidelines: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (18.5 <= BMI < 25), overweight (25 <= BMI < 30), or obese (BMI >= 30).
Display the calculated BMI, weight category, and a recommendation message based on the user's BMI category.<br>
4.Enhance the user experience:
Add event listeners to the height and weight input fields to automatically update the BMI calculation whenever the user enters new values.
Implement validation to prevent users from submitting invalid inputs (e.g., negative or zero values for height and weight).<br>
Apply CSS styling to make the BMI Calculator visually appealing and easy to use.<br>
5.Finalize the project:
Test the BMI Calculator thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
Optimize the code and UI elements for a smooth user experience.<br>
6.Host the project:
Choose a hosting platform to make your BMI Calculator accessible online (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your web hosting provider).
Upload the project files to the hosting platform.
Share the link to your BMI Calculator with your intended audience.
By following these steps, you can create a functional and user-friendly BMI Calculator using JavaScript.<br>
